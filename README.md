# BKB-Trier
A web-app for finding the nearest free parking space in Trier

## Overview and Motivation
Since February 2025, parking in Trier has become increasingly challenging due to expanded residential parking zones requiring paid permits. To counter this and promote fair access to parking, BKB (Bin Kein Bewohner) Trier provides a user-friendly web app that helps residents and visitors find nearby free parking spots quickly, reducing the stress and time spent searching for parking.

## How It Works and Features
- **Access the App:**
  Visit [BKB Trier](https://freeparkingtrier.netlify.app/) and specify your location
- **Find Parking:**
  View a list of nearby streets with available free parking spots, displayed on an interactive map
- **Stay Updated:**
  The app is regularly updated to reflect the latest parking regulations in Trier and is optimized for all devices, ensuring you get real-time information wherever you are

## Coverage Area
BKB Trier covers the city, focusing on the new and expanded Bewohnerparkzone Nord, Mitte, and SÃ¼d. Details about the affected streets are available on the [City of Trier website](https://www.trier.de/umwelt-verkehr/parken/bewohnerparken/bewohnerparkzonen/)
