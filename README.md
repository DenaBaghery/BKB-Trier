# BKB-Trier
A web-app for finding the nearest free parking space.

# Overview
Due to recent parking regulations implemented in February 2025, parking in Trier has become challenging, with many streets now requiring a paid residential parking permit (Bewohnerparkausweis). 
Believing that parking should remain free for everyone, this project provides a practical solution: a user-friendly web app to locate nearby free parking spaces instantly.

# Motivation
Since February 2025, Trier has significantly expanded its residential parking zones, restricting free parking possibilities. Residents without permits face difficulty finding free, unrestricted parking. We developed BKB (Bin Kein Bewohner) Trier to:

- Promote fair and free access to parking
- Simplify the process of finding parking spaces not affected by the new regulations
- Reduce stress and time spent searching for parking in Trier

# How It Works
- Visit the live web app: https://freeparkingtrier.netlify.app/
- Specify your location directly in the web app
- Instantly view a list of nearby streets with available free parking spots.
- Enjoy convenient, real-time information based on current city parking guidelines.

Features
- Easy Location Input: Quickly enter or detect your current location
- Interactive Map: Clearly displays the nearest streets with free parking.
- Regular Updates: Reflects the latest parking zone regulations in Trier.
- Mobile-Friendly: Optimized for use on all devices.
